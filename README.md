## Set-up Instructions
1. Create a discord server and create a channel named 'discord-bot' in it.
2. Create a discord bot and add it to this channel.
3. You could use 'https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/' for the above, to get the bot token and replace the TOKEN variable in the DiscordDictionaryBot.py file with this newly generated token.

## How to run the project?
1. Open the DiscordDictionaryBot.py file in a code editor and run it. 
2. Wait until the output says that the bot is ready. You can now see that the bot has come online in the channel.
3. Enter 'Hello' or directly type in the word you want to search the details of.
4. The bot responds with the menu-options to ask for what the user specifically wants.
5. Enter a task command and the bot responds with the required details.
